                I've been using a computer and interacting with the internet since I was 2 years old. Through my father's dusty, old Windows Vista desktop, I was introduced to the web; That was the very beginning to my discoveries of the many hobbies I love today.
            </p>
            <p>A couple of those hobbies are {identity.hobbies[0]} and {identity.hobbies[1]}.</p>
